# SCHED_BACKGROUND

A new scheduling policy for Linux We had added a new scheduling policy for the linux scheduler called SCHED_BACKGROUND that is designed to support processes that only need to run when the system has nothing else to do. This " background " scheduling policy only runs processes when there are no processes in the SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO classes to run. When there is more than one SCHED_BACKGROUND process ready to run, they should compete for the CPU as do SCHED_OTHER processes. After adding the policy we made a CPU intensive process and perform this process with each of the available scheduling policies to make a time analysis table.
